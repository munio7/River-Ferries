# River_Ferries
This project implements a simulation of ferry crossings on a river, considering vehicle traffic and the synchronization of vehicle boarding and disembarking threads. The code allows dynamic modification of the number of ferries and their capacities, as well as visualization of the system's operation through a GUI.
